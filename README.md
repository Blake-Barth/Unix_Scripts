# üñ•Ô∏è Shell & Perl Scripting Projects

This repository showcases a collection of Shell and Perl scripts made for my UNIX TOOLS class demonstrating scripting proficiency. These scripts include system utilities, data processing tools, and text manipulation programs.

| `phonebook.sh`| Shell    | Contact manager supporting add/delete/modify/search   |
| `plot.sh`     | Shell    | Plots data from a text file using `gnuplot`           |
| `justify.pl`  | Perl     | Justifies text to a specified column width            |
| `freq.pl`     | Perl     | Calculates word frequencies from standard input       |
| `head.pl`     | Perl     | Displays up to 10 lines from standard input           |

## üß™ How to Run

### Shell Scripts

```bash
chmod +x scriptname.sh
./scriptname.sh
```

### Perl Scripts

```bash
chmod +x wordfreq.pl
cat input.txt | ./wordfreq.pl
```

You can also run it interactively by typing directly into standard input:

```bash
./wordfreq.pl
Type your input text here
Press CTRL+D to end input
```
