# 🖥️ Shell & Perl Scripting Projects

This repository showcases a collection of Shell and Perl scripts designed for practical use cases and demonstrating scripting proficiency. These scripts include system utilities, data processing tools, and text manipulation programs.

## 📁 Contents

### 🐚 Shell Scripts

| Script Name     | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `cal.sh`        | A custom calendar script – possibly mimicking or enhancing the `cal` utility. |

## 🧪 How to Run

### Shell Scripts

```bash
chmod +x scriptname.sh
./scriptname.sh
```

### Perl Scripts

```bash
chmod +x wordfreq.pl
cat input.txt | ./wordfreq.pl
```

You can also run it interactively by typing directly into standard input:

```bash
./wordfreq.pl
Type your input text here
Press CTRL+D to end input
```
